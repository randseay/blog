As increasing amounts of data are loaded into a web application, it can become
necessary to introduce pagination patterns to improve the performance as well as
the user experience. A common pattern for handling this is the "infinite scroll"
paradigm. Infinite scroll is a design pattern that loads content continuously as
the user scrolls down the page, eliminating the need for traditional pagination
controls.

Many data fetching libraries support this style of pagination, and provide easy
ways to integrate data fetching. One example is
[TanStack Query's `useInfiniteQuery` hook](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/reference/useInfiniteQuery).
These libraries leave it up to you to decide when to fetch more data, and one of
the more elegant ways I've found to handle this is to create a reusable
component whose sole concern is to request more data. Below is an
`InfiniteScroll` React component using the
[`IntersectionObserver` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

All that is left to do is wire up the data fetching logic to the exposed
properties: `children`, `fetchMore`, and `hasMore`.
