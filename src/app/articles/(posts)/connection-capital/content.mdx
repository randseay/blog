I've been working on remote teams in the tech industry since 2016, and have
learned a lot of lessons over the years about building and maintaining a healthy
remote culture. The idea of connection capital has been on my mind a lot lately,
and has crystallized more for me in this season of life both personally and
professionally.

## What is Connection Capital?

Connection capital is the trust, empathy, and rapport that team members build
with each other over time. Think of it like a currency that you can spend to get
things done. Deposits can be made to increase connection capital and withdrawals
can also be made to deplete connection capital. Like monetary capital, large
amounts of connection capital have a high potential for earning more capital,
creating a virtuous cycle. Further, low amounts of connection capital ravages
teams, creating demoralizing cycles of distrust that further deplete what little
connection capital exists.

When a team has a lot of connection capital built up, its members feel
comfortable asking for help, giving direct feedback, and making mistakes. High
levels of connection capital encourages psychological safety, which is a key
factor in high-performing teams.

When a team has little connection capital, members are likely to feel
scrutinized and anxious. They are uncomfortable asking for help because the feel
they should not need help. They may respond by pushing themselves toward burning
out, doing the bare minimum in their work, or searching for the exit.

It might be easy at this point to dismiss this as a wishy washy article about
making everyone comfortable and never getting anything done. I contend that a
workplaces with high amounts of connection capital are highly successful,
innovative, and productive. The team members grow rapidly in their skills and
abilities, and the team as a whole is able to accomplish more than the sum of
its parts.

## How to Lose Connection Capital

- Unreasonable expectations
- Dehumanizing interactions
- Lack of transparency
- Lack of recognition
- Lack of boundaries
- Lack of empathy
- Unreasonable deadlines
- Disregarding feedback
- Jumping to conclusions
- Failing to understand power imbalances

A less experienced team member felt that requests for changes during code review
was a sign of failure. Something like this is very possible to work through, but
it didn't come up until their exit interview.

### Caution

- Creating an environment where team members feel they are "in the trenches" can
  lead to staying out of guilt and burnout
- It can feel good to be the hero, but it's not sustainable
- It's easy to get caught up in the "hustle" and forget to take care of yourself

## How to Build Connection Capital

When you're working remotely, it's easy to forget that your colleagues are
people who can be having a huge range of experiences at any given moment.

- Starts with leadership, if the most experienced members of the team model
  asking for help, it will encourage others to do the same
- Being curious
- Considering more generous interpretations
- Understand power imbalances
- Going out of your way to humanize interactions
- Donut Slack bot
- Virtual coffee breaks
- Fikas
- Regular, low-intensity check-ins
- Virtual Offices
- Meeting in person
- Being transparent
- Keeping good boundaries
- Recognizing and rewarding each other (Taco Slack bot)
