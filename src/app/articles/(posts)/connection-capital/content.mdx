I've been working on remote teams in the tech industry since 2016, and have
learned a lot of lessons over the years about building and maintaining a healthy
remote culture.

## What is Connection Capital?

Connection capital is the trust, empathy, and rapport that team members build
with each other over time. Think of it like a currency that you can spend to get
things done. Deposits can be made to increase connection capital, and
withdrawals can also be made to deplete connection capital. Like monetary
capital, large amounts of connection capital have a high potential for earning
more capital, creating a virtuous cycle. Further, low amounts of connection
capital ravages teams, creating demoralizing cycles of distrust that further
deplete what little connection capital exists.

When a team has a lot of connection capital built up, its members feel
comfortable asking for help, giving direct feedback, and making mistakes. High
levels of connection capital encourages psychological safety, which is a key
factor in high-performing teams.

When a team has little connection capital, members are likely to feel
scrutinized and anxious. They are uncomfortable asking for help because the feel
they should already know. They may respond by pushing themselves toward burning
out, doing the bare minimum in their work, or searching for the exit.

## How to Lose Connection Capital

- Unreasonable expectations
- Dehumanizing interactions
- Lack of transparency
- Lack of recognition
- Lack of boundaries
- Lack of empathy
- Unreasonable deadlines
- Disregarding feedback
- Jumping to conclusions

### Caution

- Being "in the trenches" can lead to guilt and burnout
- It can feel good to be the hero, but it's not sustainable
- It's easy to get caught up in the "hustle" and forget to take care of yourself

## How to Build Connection Capital

When you're working remotely, it's easy to forget that your colleagues are
people who can be having a huge range of experiences at any given moment.
