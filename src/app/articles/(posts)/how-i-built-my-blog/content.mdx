## Intro

When it came time to revisit my personal blog, I wanted to use it as an
opportunity to dive deeper into some technologies I found interesting. I decided
to build it using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**. This post will
walk you through the process, the tools I used, and some of the challenges I
faced along the way. I love writing in markdown, and wanted to emulate the
visual aesthetics of documentation sites like [react.dev](https://react.dev/).

## Overview and Tools

This blog was first built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13, and has since
been updated to version 15. At the time the App directory was a new concept, and I was
excited to try it out. TypeScript is a non-negotiable for me, and Tailwind CSS
is just a pleasure to use. I tried to keep the project structure simple. The few
routes I have are focused on MDX content wherever possible, with Tailwind's
typography tools providing a clean reading experience. I generally built shared
components as I needed them.

### Styling and Theming

I used **Tailwind CSS** for styling, which allows for rapid development with
utility-first CSS classes. I also implemented dark mode using the
[`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) package. I have a
special passion for dark mode, and really enjoyed implementing the theme
switcher. Give it a shot! You can toggle between light and dark modes, or track
system preferences.

The design is minimalistic, focusing on readability and ease of navigation. The
typefaces are on the larger side, and I selected monospace fonts for headings.
To me, the reading experience is paramount, and I wanted to ensure that the blog
is accessible and enjoyable to read.

As a side note, I really loved the idea of changing the primary colors between
light and dark mode, while making the opposite theme's primary color the
secondary color. I think this worked out pretty well, and I hope you like it
too!

## Writing Experience

I wanted to create a writing experience that was both enjoyable and efficient.
For me, that is markdown without all of the distractions of a WYSIWYG editor or
complex tooling. I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write posts, which allows me
to combine markdown with necessary React components. This gives me the
flexibility to inject code blocks or leverage more carefully styled components.

Importing and listing the blogs is one of the areas I intend to streamline, as
it is a bit cumbersome right now. I have a directory structure that organizes
the posts and assembles them into a list, but I would like to automate this
further in the future.

The code editor is powered by
[@codesandbox/sandpack-react](https://sandpack.dev/), which allows me to embed
interactive code examples directly into my posts. Setting this up is a bit
manual, and definitely another area I want to improve in the future. I'm able to
supply a template string for the code examples, which makes it easier to manage
and update them.

### Dynamic Features

For now I have targeted tag filtering and RSS feed generation as the main
dynamic features of the blog. The tag filtering allows readers to easily find
articles by their associated tags, while the RSS feed generation provides a way
for users to subscribe to the blog and receive updates. Tag filtering is handled
through query parameters in the URL, and the RSS feed is generated using the
[`feed`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) package. This allows me to create a
customized feed for my blog. This was a perfect combination to use with a
Next.js API routes, where it can all be handled on the server with no build
step.

### Deployment

Vercel is the hosting platform I chose for this blog, as it integrates
seamlessly with Next.js and provides a great developer experience. Deployment is
straightforward, and Vercel's serverless functions allow me to handle dynamic
features like the RSS feed generation without any hassle. From adding to a
domain to monitoring deployments, Vercel has made the process smooth and
efficient. I couldn't ask for anything better in terms of deployment and
hosting.

### Challenges

While building this blog, I faced several challenges. One of the main challenges
was getting the MDX setup right, especially with the code editor integration. I
had to ensure that the code blocks were properly formatted and that the
interactive examples worked as expected. I'm also not totally satisfied with the
manual nature of publishing posts. I'd like to get this down to simply creating
a new `.mdx` file and populating the proper metadata, but I'm not there yet. I came
across an excellent
[example from Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog)
that I plan to take some inspiration from.

I also really needed to upgrade to Next.js 15 much sooner than I did, version 13
became outdated quickly and lacked some of the features I wanted to use.

### Conclusion

Overall I'm quite pleased with how this blog turned out. It was a great
opportunity to learn more about some amazing web technologies, and I have a nice
direction and ideas for improvements moving forward.

If you have been thinking about building your own blog or personal website, I
highly encourage you to take the plunge. There are so many great tools and
resources available that make it easier than ever to get started. There are some
great templates you can leverage, but rolling your own is full of amazing
learning opportunities and can be a lot of fun. I hope this post has given you
some insight into how I built my blog and the tools I used along the way. If you
have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
