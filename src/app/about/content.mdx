# More About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and
building innovative applications. My formal education is from the
University of North Dakota, where I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in
Graphic Design & New Art Media. After a successful start as a graphic
designer at the local ad agency, I dove headlong into learning web development.
