        <p>
          My formal education is from the University of North Dakota, where I
          received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design & New Art Media.
          After a successful start as a graphic designer at the great ad agency,
          Ad Monkeys in Grand Forks, ND, I dove headlong into learning web
          development.
